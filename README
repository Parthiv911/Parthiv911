Hand Written Digit Recognizer

The classifier takes an 8*8 pixel greyscale image as input and classifies it into one of the 10 digits.
Support Vector Machine Classifier with gamma = 0.001 was used.
Around 25% of the Data Set was used to test the model. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The resultant accuracy score was found to be greater than 96%.

The Confusion Matrix is as follows

Confusion matrix:
   0   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
0 [42  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0]
1 [ 0 46  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
2 [ 0  0 43  0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
3 [ 0  0  0 40  0  2  0  1  4  0]
4 [ 0  0  0  0 45  0  0  0  1  2]
5 [ 0  0  0  0  0 44  1  0  0  0]
6 [ 0  0  0  0  0  0 47  0  0  0]
7 [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0 45  0  0]
8 [ 0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0 40  0]
9 [ 0  0  0  1  0  1  0  0  0 43]]

(By definition a confusion matrix is such that Cij is equal to the number of observations known to be in group i and predicted to be in group j)
